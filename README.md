# Overview of Celo Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding is a method of raising capital through the collective effort of friends, family, customers, and individual investors. This approach taps into the collective efforts of a large pool of individuals—primarily online via social media and crowdfunding platforms—and leverages their networks for greater reach and exposure.

In the context of blockchain technology, crowdfunding takes on a new dimension. With Celo’s blockchain, we can create a decentralized crowdfunding platform. This means that the platform is not controlled by any single entity, and transactions are transparent and secure.

## Understanding Celo’s Crowdfunding System

Celo’s crowdfunding system is built on smart contracts. A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They allow trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

In our crowdfunding system, each project will be a new smart contract on the blockchain. This contract will hold the funds raised by the project and will have rules in place to determine how these funds can be withdrawn by the project creator.

## Why is Crowdfunding Important?

Crowdfunding is important because it provides opportunities for entrepreneurs, artists, and individuals to realize their goals and bring their projects to life. It democratizes access to capital and allows anyone, anywhere, to support projects they believe in.

In the context of blockchain, crowdfunding also demonstrates the power of decentralized finance. It shows how blockchain can remove intermediaries, reduce costs, and increase transparency in financial transactions.

## Benefits and Challenges of Using Decentralized Crowdfunding

Decentralized crowdfunding offers several benefits over traditional crowdfunding:

- **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, making it easy for backers to see exactly where their money is going.
- **Security:** Funds are stored in a smart contract on the blockchain, making it nearly impossible for funds to be misused or stolen.
- **Accessibility:** Anyone, anywhere in the world, can participate in a crowdfunding campaign on the blockchain.

However, there are also challenges to consider:

- **Smart contract bugs:** If there are bugs in the smart contract code, funds could be lost or stolen.
- **Regulatory uncertainty:** The legal status of decentralized crowdfunding is still unclear in many jurisdictions.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of decentralized crowdfunding make it an exciting area for exploration and innovation.

## Fetching Real-Time Information

In a crowdfunding platform, it’s important to have real-time information about each project. This includes information like the amount of funds raised, the number of backers, and the time remaining in the campaign.

With Celo’s blockchain, we can fetch this information directly from the smart contract. Each time a backer contributes funds to a project, the smart contract will automatically update its state. We can then fetch this state from the blockchain to get real-time information about the project.

## Ensuring Reliability with Crowdfunding

Reliability is crucial in a crowdfunding platform. Backers need to trust that the platform will handle their funds securely and that the information presented about each project is accurate.

With Celo’s blockchain, we can ensure reliability in several ways:

- **Secure smart contracts:** By writing secure smart contract code and thoroughly testing it, we can minimize the risk of bugs that could lead to lost or stolen funds.
- **Transparent transactions:** Because all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, backers can verify for themselves that their funds have been correctly allocated.
- **Immutable records:** Once a transaction has been recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be changed. This ensures that the history of each project is permanently recorded and cannot be tampered with.

## Setting Up Celo’s Crowdfunding Integration

Now that we understand the basics of Celo’s crowdfunding system, let’s start building our platform.

### Install Celo’s Crowdfunding Library

First, we need to install the Celo library and other necessary dependencies. Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
npm install @celo/contractkit express web3
```

This will install the Celo ContractKit library, the Express.js web framework, and the Web3.js library for interacting with Ethereum-based blockchains.

### Import the Crowdfunding Contract

Next, we need to import the crowdfunding smart contract. Create a new file in your project directory called Crowdfunding.sol and add the following code:

```bash
pragma solidity ^0.5.16;

contract Crowdfunding {
    // ... contract code goes here ...
}
```

This is just a placeholder for now. In the next steps, we’ll add functions to this contract for creating projects, contributing to projects, and withdrawing funds.

### Initialize the Crowdfunding Contract

Now, let’s initialize the crowdfunding contract. In your server.js file, add the following code:

```bash
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit');
const Web3 = require('web3');

const web3 = new Web3('https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org');
const kit = ContractKit.newKitFromWeb3(web3);

// ... rest of the code goes here ...
```

This code creates a new instance of Web3 connected to the Celo Alfajores testnet and initializes a new instance of ContractKit using this Web3 instance.

### Retrieve Data from the Crowdfunding

Next, we’ll add a function to retrieve data from the crowdfunding contract. Add the following code to your server.js file:

```bash
app.get('/projects/:id', async (req, res) => {
    const crowdfunding = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(
        // ABI of the crowdfunding contract
        [],
        // Address of the crowdfunding contract
        '0x...'
    );

    const project = await crowdfunding.methods.getProject(req.params.id).call();

    res.send(project);
});
```

This code creates a new route that fetches data about a project from the crowdfunding contract and sends it as a response. The getProject method is a placeholder for now - we’ll implement it in the next steps.

## Deploy and Test

Now that we have set up our server and initialized the crowdfunding contract, it’s time to deploy and test our platform.

To deploy the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see a message saying that the server is running. You can now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/projects/1 to fetch data about project 1.

## Retrieving External Data in Smart Contracts

In the context of a crowdfunding platform, external data can be crucial. For instance, you might want to fetch real-time exchange rates to allow contributions in different currencies, or you might want to integrate with a third-party service to perform KYC checks on project creators.

With Celo’s blockchain, you can fetch external data using oracles. An oracle is a way for a blockchain to interact with external data. You can think of it as a data feed that your smart contract can read from. In a full tutorial, we would dive deeper into how to set up and use an oracle with Celo.

## Define the Data Request

The first step to using an oracle is to define the data request. This is a description of the data you want to fetch. For instance, if you want to fetch the current USD to cGLD exchange rate, your data request might look like this:

```javascript
const dataRequest = {
  currency: 'cGLD',
  to: 'USD',
};
```

## Query the Oracle

Next, you need to query the oracle with your data request. The oracle will fetch the data from an external source and return it to your smart contract. Here’s how you might do it:

```javascript
const exchangeRate = await oracle.getExchangeRate(dataRequest);
```

## Fulfill the Data Request

Once the oracle has fetched the data, you can use it in your smart contract. For instance, you might use the exchange rate to calculate the amount of cGLD a contributor will receive for their USD contribution:

```javascript
const contributionInUSD = 100;
const contributionInCGLD = contributionInUSD * exchangeRate;
```

## Test and Validate

After setting up the oracle integration, it’s important to test it thoroughly. Write tests that cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. Make sure the oracle correctly fetches data and your smart contract correctly uses this data.

## Ensuring Data Reliability and Security

When using an oracle, it’s crucial to ensure the data it provides is reliable and secure. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

- Use a Trusted Oracle: 
Ensure you’re using an oracle that is known to be reliable and secure. Celo provides its own oracle for fetching exchange rates, which is likely to be more reliable than a third-party oracle.

- Verify the Data: 
Before using the data provided by the oracle, verify it against other sources. This can help you catch any inaccuracies or manipulations.

- Handle Errors Gracefully: 
If the oracle fails to fetch the data or returns an error, make sure your smart contract handles this gracefully. This might mean reverting any transactions that rely on the oracle data.

## Data Verification

Data verification is a crucial aspect of working with oracles. Here are some strategies for verifying oracle data:

- Cross-reference with other sources: If possible, cross-reference the oracle data with other reliable sources. This can help you catch any discrepancies.
  
- Check the update time: Oracles should provide the time of the last update. Ensure this is recent enough for your needs.
  
- Use multiple oracles: For added reliability, you can use multiple oracles and take the median of their responses.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve just built a simple DApp on the Celo blockchain. This is just the beginning - there’s much more you can do with Celo and ContractKit. Happy coding!
